# Accessing the Visualization
With access to the source code, you can locally host the project from the base directory by using the python server module.

Python3:
`python3 -m http.server 8000`

Python2:
`python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

In your chosen browser navigate to the `/site` directory, you should load by default the `index.html` page which is the view for the interactive webpage. If not, nagivate to `/site/index.html` explicitly.

We are not actively hosting the project on any server, so viewing this project locally is necessary.

# Supported browsers
The project was built only to be supported on Chrome for Windows, Linux, and Mac, though likely should work fine on alternate browsers on most operating system distributions.
